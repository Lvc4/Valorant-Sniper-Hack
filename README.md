# Valorant-Sniper-Hack
An undetactable trigger hack for Valorant.

### Why is it undetacable?
Becaues it just takes screenshots of the area around your curser
and looks for changes. If any changes  appear is triggers a shoot.
So there is no software inject or something that could interfear with Valorants AntiCheat


## Installation

Install the requirements

```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Other requirements:

    - Python3.x
    - Valorant
    - only tested on Windows10
## Run

```bash
  puthon3 main.py
```

Then start Valorant and start gaming

To activate the running bot press 'f'.

Then when any changes around the cursor apper it will shoot i 30 milli seconds.

So dont move and wait for the enemy to walk in.

After the bot shot it deactivates itself and you need to press f again for activasion.
